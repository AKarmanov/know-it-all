# Know it all

https://knowitall-9a92e.firebaseapp.com/

The goal of know-it-all is to help you discover things 
that you don't know about web development.

And maybe one day about other things too.

At the moment, in November 2016, the data is ready, but
not hooked up to the UI. It should all be done by
the end of the year.

## Contributing
I'd be delighted to get help from the greater community, I imagine
in typing out all that data I made some mistakes. But
please no contributions just yet. I'm still sussing out
what the best format is going to be for the data.
